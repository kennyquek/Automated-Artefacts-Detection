# Automated Artefacts Detection (Tensorflow Python)
Automated artefacts detection for OCT-Angiography images using deep learning image classification (CNN). The goal of this work is to develop an OCT-Angiography based image Defect Detection System (DDS) using deep learning to automatically identify the presence of artefacts in OCT-Angiography images in order to reduce misinterpretation.
